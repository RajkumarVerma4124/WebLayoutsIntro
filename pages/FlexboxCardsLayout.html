                <h3>BMW Vision M Next</h3>
                <p>The Vision M Next, revealed in summer 2019, is the M1 reborn for the 21st century. A mid-engine profile and swing-up doors allows it screams presence, while a 600-horsepower hybrid powertrain means it has the punch to back up those looks.
                    Let's hope BMW has plans to put it into production.</p>

                <h3>Karma SC2</h3>
                <p>The only car Karma currently builds is its Revero sedan, which is basically a rehashed Fisker Karma. But in late 2019, it revealed this, the SC2 concept, an all-electric 1100-horsepower supercar which is supposed to represent the future
                    of the brand. We have our reservations, but those massive scissor doors are pretty cool.</p>

                <h3>Tesla Cybertruck</h3>
                <p>No matter your opinion on Tesla or Elon Musk, you have to admit: the Cybertruck is one wild proposition. Just look at it! It's a future-mobile with a wild cyborg-like design and angles sharp enough to cut through a phonebook. We can't
                    wait to see the production version.</p>

                <h3>Rolls-Royce 103EX</h3>
                <p>The 103EX was supposed to represent Rolls-Royce's idea for the future in 2016. Wildly different than any Rolls production car, it doesn't have a steering wheel, or even a driver's seat. The only place to sit is a massive couch; a place
                    to relax while you're taken to your destination in ultimate comfort.</p>

                <p>Porsche's halo car stands as a striking monument to a moment in time when hundred year-old fuel burning technology merged with electric power to create a wave of flagship vehicles that changed all the rules.</p>

                <p>If you thought the Vision 6 coupe couldn't get any better, you were probably shocked to see the Cabriolet version. It looks like a yacht on wheels, with a stunning interior and a massive rear overhang.</p>

                <p>The Opel GT concept from Geneva 2016 didn't lead to a production car, but it was still incredibly neat. It had everything we want from a modern performance coupe: Great looks, tight proportions, and a low curb weight.</p>

                <p>The RX-Vision is Mazda's representation of what a future rotary-powered sports car might look like, and it's stunning. Sadly, it's still just a concept for now.</p>

                <h3>Jeep J6</h3>
                <p>Introduced at Easter Jeep Safari last year, the J6 concept is basically the two-door, long-bed Gladiator of our fantasies. The proportions are perfect, and we can't help but prefer it over the normal Gladiator.</p>

                <h3>Renault Trezor</h3>
                <p>The Trezor was released in 2016 in Paris, sporting a version of Renault's Formula E drivetrain and autonomous driving tech. But it was the stunning design that had everyone really excited. It's too bad a production version never came to
                    fruition.

                <h3>GFG Style Kangaroo</h3>
                <p>Spawned from the minds of Giorgetto Giugiario and his son, the GFG Style Kangaroo combines supercar proportions with an unconventional off-road ride height. It also has gullwing windows, which is undeniably awesome.

                <p>The ID. Buggy is the latest in a string of ID-badged concepts from VW, aimed at showing off the brand's new modular electric platform. We think it's the coolest of the bunch.</p>
